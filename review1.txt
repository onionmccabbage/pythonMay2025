Review 1 40 minutes (unti 2:25) - then show and tell
========
Write a game: Guess an integer between 0 and 100
Ask the user to enter a guess, until they guess correctly 

If it's too high or too low tell them
When they get it right the game ends
(Remember to validate that an integer was entered) 

Optional
--------
entering -1 quits the game (tell them the answer)
entering -2 offers hints: is it even, is it odd, is it a prime number or is it a square?
here is a tuple of primes
primes_t = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97)

Count how many guesses they took, and print this at the end
Maybe ask the user for the game difficulty (0-100, 0-1000 etc.)

Use documentation, look online, ask me, ask each other...

Additional libraries to install:
> requests (did this Weds)
- python -m pip install ....
- py -3 -m pip install numpy
- py -3 -m pip install pandas
These will then be available for ever


In Python everything is an object (aka a class)

Getting ready to code
    > Getting Started: Python, editors and integrated development environments (IDEs)
    > Scripts & Syntax: Basic syntax, script execution, console input/output

...there will be an exercise after lunch - build something and maybe share what you built
q - explain the types of exception (and their hierachy)

Core Python Syntax
    > Numbers: Integers and floats
    > Strings: Syntax, manipulation, formatting
    > Collections: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
    > Accessing members of collections
    > Operators & Expressions: Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
    > Conditions & Loops: if/else, for/while loops, continue/break  
    Range comprehensions functions

Structuring Python code
    > Functions: invocation, passing in arguments and returning values
    Objects and Classes: Declaration, creating instances, methods and attributes, inheritance
    Getter/Setter decorators, name-mangling and slots
    Modules and Packages: Writing and importing from modules
    > Exception Handling: try/except/finally

Practical Python applications (covered depending on demand)
    > Files: Reading and writing text files. Using 'with'
    Databases: Connecting, querying, and updating databases
    Spreadsheets: Reading and writing data
    Internet and APIs: Requesting web data, handling JSON

There will be an opportunity to give end-of-course fedback

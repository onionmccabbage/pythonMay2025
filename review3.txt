Review 4 (Data analysis) 50 mins until 2:35
========================
Create a new Jupyter Notebook (or a simple python module)
- read in external data (data/flights.csv) into a data frame
  or (MUCH bigger dataset) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/master/data/flights.csv
- show the description (make a df then df.describe() )
- show the dtypes
- find the mean flight time e.g.
  print(df.groupby('AIRLINE')[['AIR_TIME']].mean())
- also show the count and min (e.g. like this:)
  print(df.groupby('AIRLINE')[['DEPARTURE_DELAY']].min())
‐ Group the data into a separate data frame for any single airline
  e.g. DL_ = df[df['AIRLINE']=='DL']

In the flights data set, find:
‐ The number of flight records (i.e. count())
‐ The number of unique airlines (use nunique)
‐ How many unique aircraft are represented (tail number)

For the following decide what is meant by 'delay'
‐ The minimum and mean departure delay for your chosen airlines (or all)
  here's one approach:
    i = df[['DEPARTURE_DELAY', 'ARRIVAL_DELAY', 'DISTANCE']]
    i.agg(['min', 'mean'])
‐ Find the greatest recorded delay (show the related data)

Optional: Consider how you can address the following challenges:
‐ On average, which airline is the most punctual
‐ Which airline arrives ahead of time most often
‐ Does flight duration appear to affect arrival punctuality more for some airlines than others
‐ Does time of day appear to affect departure punctuality across all flights
‐ Are the standard deviations of flight duration close to the standard deviations of flight distance
- Fimd the mean delay for just the first 50 records in the dataset, 
  then for all delays of 15 or more units
